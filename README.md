Working in such a big and multi page project was a very good experience . The best takeaway for me is learning to reuse code when working on big projects.
I also learned and got better in designing and animating contents.
Loading this site takes time due to the number of images presrnt for whichi had to compress them and add a suitablwe loader. 

### HOPE YOU LIKE IT...
